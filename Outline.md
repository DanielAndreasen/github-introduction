## Github for scientists
Scientists have special/different demands for their software and how to store it.
For example we are being evaluated through papers and their impact in the community.
Therefore codes are now [citable](https://github.com/blog/1840-improving-github-for-science).

It is also possible for scientist to get some [free private repositories](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new)
for papers in progres or source code which can not be open.  
Note that private repositories can still be shared if the owner gives the permission in the settings.
